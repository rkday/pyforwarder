pyforwarder - method forwarding library for Python
==================================================

This is a Python library inspired by https://github.com/RobertDober/Forwarder, intended to make method forwarding (and therefore composition-over-inheritance) easier in Python.

See the ``tests/`` folder for usage examples.
